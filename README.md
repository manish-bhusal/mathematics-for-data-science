# Learn Statistics Concept

Statistics is like a big puzzle. Imagine you have a big box full of different colored blocks. Some blocks are red, some are blue, some are green, and so on.

Statistics is a way to figure out things about those blocks. Like, how many blocks are red? How many blocks are blue? Are there more red blocks or more blue blocks? Or maybe they are the same?

We use statistics to help us understand data, like the blocks in our box. We can use statistics to count things, to compare things, to make predictions, and to understand patterns.

For example, if you want to know how many blocks of each color you have, you would use statistics to count the number of red blocks, the number of blue blocks, and so on. If you want to know which color is the most common, you would use statistics to compare the number of red blocks to the number of blue blocks. And if you want to predict how many blocks of a certain color will be in the box in the future, you would use statistics to make that prediction.

So, statistics is like a tool that helps us understand data, like the blocks in our box, by counting, comparing and predicting.

# Descriptive Statistics Vs. Inferential Statistics

Descriptive statistics is used to summarize and describe data. It helps us understand what the data looks like and what the main patterns and features are. For example, if you have a set of numbers that represent the heights of people in a group, you can use descriptive statistics to find the average height (mean) and the most common height (mode) and how much the heights vary(standard deviation) in that group. You can also use visual tools like histograms, box plots, etc to understand the distribution of data.

Inferential statistics, on the other hand, is used to make predictions or inferences about a larger population based on a sample of data. For example, if you survey a small group of people about their political views and want to know what the views of all people are, you can use inferential statistics to make predictions about the views of the entire population based on the views of the people in your sample. This is done by using statistical models to estimate population parameters from sample statistics.

So, descriptive statistics helps us understand what the data looks like, while inferential statistics helps us make predictions or inferences about a larger population based on a sample of data.

# Outlier

An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations. A value that "lies outside"(is much smaller or larger) than most of the other values in a set of data. For example: 25, 29, 3, 32, 85, 33, 27, 28, both **3** and **85** are **Outliers**.

# Percentile

A percentile is a way of measuring where a particular value falls in relation to the rest of the values in a dataset. Percentiles divide a dataset into 100 equal parts and tell you which part of the dataset a particular value falls into.

For example, if you have a list of 100 students' test scores and you want to know what score is at the 75th percentile, that means 75% of the students scored below that value and 25% scored above it. If a student scored higher than 75th percentile, that student is better than 75% of the students.

Percentile is a commonly used measure in statistics and it is used to understand the distribution of a dataset. For example, if you want to know what the typical score is for a test, you can look at the 50th percentile, which is also called the median. The median is the middle value of a dataset, so half of the scores are above the median and half are below it.

Percentiles are also used in many other fields like finance, healthcare and many more. Percentiles can be used to understand how a particular value compares to other values in a dataset, which can be useful for making decisions or comparing different groups of data.

# Quantiles

Quantiles are similar to percentiles in that they divide a dataset into equal parts and tell you where a particular value falls in relation to the rest of the values. However, unlike percentiles, which divide the dataset into 100 parts, quantiles divide the dataset into a specified number of parts.

For example, if you have a dataset of 100 values and you want to divide it into 4 parts, you would use quartiles. Quartiles are a type of quantile and they divide the dataset into 4 parts, or quarters. The first quartile (Q1) is the 25th percentile, the second quartile (Q2) is the median (50th percentile) and the third quartile (Q3) is the 75th percentile.

Similarly, if you want to divide a dataset into 5 parts, you would use quintiles. Quintiles divide the dataset into 5 parts and the first quintile is the 20th percentile, second quintile is 40th percentile and so on.

In general, quantiles are useful for understanding the distribution of a dataset and for comparing different groups of data. They can be used to identify outliers, or values that are significantly different from the rest of the values in the dataset. In addition, quantiles can also be used to identify the spread of the data, for example, if the difference between first and third quartile is large, it means the data is spread out.

In summary, quantiles are similar to percentiles in that they divide a dataset into equal parts and tell you where a particular value falls in relation to the rest of the values, but unlike percentiles, which divide the dataset into 100 parts, quantiles divide the dataset into a specified number of parts.
